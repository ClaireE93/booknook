BookNook is a personal library app. It utilizes Amazon's Product Marketing API to generate book recommendations for shelved items.

To setup this app:
1) Create a config folder in the root directory.
2) Add ```amazon.js``` and export your ```SECRET_KEY``` and ```ACCESS_KEY```
3) Run MongoDB server using ```mongod```
4) Run this app from the root directory with the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run compile
npm start
```

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).
